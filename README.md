# Enhanced User Search Experience

## Overview
This goal of this project is to create a tool which will search for information from huge corpus of documents. I used RAG based system to create a vector database and created a smart content retrieval system. 

This system will retrieve data from huge documents of content and answers the users query based on it. It uses a LLM api call in the backend to process the retrived chunks from the Vector Database and gives a proper formated answer for the user.

## To Run 
- python main.py
- Folders like docs, internet are used for testing purposes please avoid it.


## Technologies Used
Python, FAISS algorithm, Vector Databases (like ChromaDB), Gradio (for web interface)
